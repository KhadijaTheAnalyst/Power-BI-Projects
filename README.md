# Patient Data Analytics Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing patient data using Power BI. The analysis includes key metrics such as patient demographics, wait times, and satisfaction scores to provide insights into hospital performance and patient experience.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive dashboard that helps healthcare providers understand patient demographics, satisfaction trends, and operational efficiency. By analyzing various patient factors such as age, gender, race, and referral departments, we aim to uncover key patterns that can assist in decision-making and improving patient care.

- **Age Group Classification**: Automatically categorizes patients into age groups (Infant, Toddler, Childhood, Teenager, Adult) for easier analysis.
- **Wait Time Analysis**: Visualizes average wait times by department and patient characteristics.
- **Satisfaction Score**: Tracks patient satisfaction scores and trends over time.
- **Demographic Insights**: Analyzes patient gender, race, and referral department.
